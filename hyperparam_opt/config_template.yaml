#  osprey worker config.yaml

estimator:
    # The model/estimator to be fit.

    # pick one of these ways to specify
      # path to a file
    pickle: model.pickle

strategy:
    # the search section specifies the space of hyperparameters to search over
    # and the strategy for doing so

    # hyperopt's tree of parzen estimators http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/
    # and random search are curently supported.
    name: random  # or gp, hyperopt_tpe
    # params: {}

search_space:
  # the search space is specified by listing the variables you want to
  # optimize over and their bounds for float and int typed variables,
  # or the possible choices for enumeration-typed variables.
